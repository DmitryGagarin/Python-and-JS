It's a try of doing something in web-development using primitive technologies. 
To write a code, I used a video sample from You-Tube, so it was like a dictant where I had to code as faster as author speaks
This project is a bookshop website with catalog, cart (doesn't work)
I spent a lot of time to develop faults. Most of them were because of inattentive and misspelling 
Need to be mentioned that i had no experience in JS at all, but, luckly, during copyrighting video athur's code I find understanding of JS code not as complicated as I thought before

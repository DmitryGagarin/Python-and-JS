This task consists of 3 stages:
1) Training 1 - just a code from somebody's video. Crucial for first experience. None line code was written myself, it was just an attempt.
There's only frontend, no backend at all. Used HTML, CSS, JS, JSON

2) Training 2 - partly the same idea as previous, but the realization of code is a work of mine. Tried some framework features. There's a small part of backend such as 
registration, login, etc

P.S. Wish me a luck!

1) Training 1 - Just a code from somebody's video, but i did not just copy it, i was trying to realise what he was doing. Crucial for first experience.
None line code was written myself, it was just an attempt.
There's only frontend, no backend at all. Used HTML, CSS, JS, JSON. I used this project to understand what JavaScript is, its basics.
Also need to said that I made a mistake somewhere so the functional of the site is not as completely as it was in that video.

2) Training 2 - I took a random website design, made it up (сверстал), add some features (pie chart and sidebar). The main purpose of this
projects is to try myself in HTML and CSS mostly. Also used JQuery library to make a sidebar. Decided not to make a registration because 
to make it real, I had to recode all the project. 

3) Training 3 - The idea of this projects is the same with Training 1. This project was done with the use of DJango, HTML, CSS. I was just wathing a video
and soaking up the main ideas of this framework. This project containg: templates affected by models and views, database, login and registration forms,
opportunity to add content also. (хуже джанго ничего еще не придумали)

P.S. Wish me a luck!

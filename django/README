 The idea of this directory is to leant Django and use knowledge in projects in the folder "web-site" such as to make a registartion on the
"training_2". Most of this code is written according to the course from YouTube. I did it to get a least minimum amount of knowledge about
Django and to recognize do I like it or not. Probably this folder will have some more pet-projects which will be about creating websites with only the 
use of Django Framework. Sounds terrifying...
